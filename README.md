# Social Scoring and Messaging mobile App

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a platform that enables individuals to interact with strangers they encounter in real life without the need for direct, in-person communication. The app aims to facilitate casual, anonymous conversations and introduce a unique "social score" feature to promote engagement.

## Key Features
1. **Discover Nearby Users**  
   Users can view a list of other app users within their vicinity. This feature makes it easy to identify and connect with people around them.

2. **Profile Viewing and Social Scoring**  
   Users can explore the profiles of nearby individuals and assign them a "social score" based on their impression in real life (e.g., appearance or demeanor). This score reflects a lightweight, subjective rating system for social interactions.

3. **Messaging**  
   Users can send messages to other users theyâ€™ve rated or discovered.

4. **Real Connections**  
   The app encourages genuine interactions by allowing users to exchange real contact information if the conversation is meaningful.

## Purpose and Use Cases
- Provide a simple and non-intrusive way for users to connect and share thoughts with people they encounter in their daily lives.  
- Enable users to offer feedback, compliments, or comments to others in a way that might not be feasible in person.  
- Foster opportunities for new friendships or relationships in a digital-first, socially dynamic manner.
