# Anonymous Messaging and Social Scoring mobile App

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a platform that enables individuals to interact with strangers they encounter in real life without the need for direct, in-person communication. The app aims to facilitate casual, anonymous conversations and introduce a unique "social score" feature to promote engagement.

## Key Features
1. **Discover Nearby Users**  
   Users can view a list of other app users within their vicinity. This feature makes it easy to identify and connect with people around them.

2. **Profile Viewing and Social Scoring**  
   Users can explore the profiles of nearby individuals and assign them a "social score" based on their impression in real life (e.g., appearance or demeanor). This score reflects a lightweight, subjective rating system for social interactions.

3. **Anonymous Messaging**  
   Users can send private messages to other users theyâ€™ve rated or discovered. Messages are initially sent anonymously, but the sender has the option to reveal their identity later in the conversation.

4. **Real Connections**  
   The app encourages genuine interactions by allowing users to exchange real contact information if the conversation is meaningful.

## Purpose and Use Cases
- Provide a simple and non-intrusive way for users to connect and share thoughts with people they encounter in their daily lives.  
- Enable users to offer feedback, compliments, or comments to others in a way that might not be feasible in person.  
- Foster opportunities for new friendships or relationships in a digital-first, socially dynamic manner.  

## Vision
This app is designed to be a quick and intuitive tool for casual interactions, fostering meaningful connections while providing users with the option to share feedback in an indirect but impactful way. By bridging the gap between virtual communication and real-world encounters, it opens up new opportunities for social engagement.
